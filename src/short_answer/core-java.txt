and re-use of code components or variables without allowing access to the system
- Inheritance: lets programmers create new classes that share the attributes of existing ones, this
allows coders to build upon previous work and have progress saved
- Polymorphism: Allows coders to use the same word for two different things in different contexts,
the two forms of this are; method overloading: when the code implies different meanings and
method overriding: when the values of the supplied variables have different meaning.
